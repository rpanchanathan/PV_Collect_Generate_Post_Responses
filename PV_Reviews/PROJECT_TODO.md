# PV Reviews - Master TODO List & Progress Tracker

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-08  
**Current Phase:** Architecture Migration Planning  
**Thread Status:** Ready for Handover - Migration Plan Complete

## üéØ OVERALL GOAL
Complete automated review collection ‚Üí AI response generation ‚Üí human review ‚Üí automated posting workflow

---

## Phase 1: Fix Foundation ‚úÖ **[COMPLETED]**

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] **Documentation mismatch identified** - AUTOMATION_SETUP.md incorrectly claims SQLite
- [x] **Current system analysis** - CSV-based collection system exists
- [x] **Master CSV duplicate prevention** - Already implemented in review_collector.py
- [x] **Fix AUTOMATION_SETUP.md** - Updated to reflect actual CSV system (removed SQLite references)
- [x] **Create Master Database CSV** - Created `data/reviews_master_database.csv` with 264 unreplied reviews
- [x] **Design enhanced CSV schema** - Added 9 human review & status tracking columns

---

## Phase 2: Enhanced Data Structure ‚úÖ **[COMPLETED]**

### Schema Additions ‚úÖ COMPLETED:
- [x] `RESPONSE_TEXT` (AI generated response)
- [x] `RESPONSE_GENERATED` (timestamp)
- [x] `RESPONSE_STATUS` (`not_generated` | `pending_review` | `approved` | `needs_revision` | `rejected`)
- [x] `RESPONSE_REVIEWED_BY` (reviewer name)
- [x] `RESPONSE_REVIEWED_ON` (timestamp)  
- [x] `POSTING_STATUS` (`not_ready` | `ready_to_post` | `posted` | `failed`)
- [x] `POSTED_ON` (timestamp)
- [x] `SENTIMENT` (from AI analysis)
- [x] `ISSUES` (from AI analysis)

**Current Status**: Master database has 28 columns total (19 original + 9 new workflow columns)

---

## Phase 3: Human Review Interface ‚è≥ **[IN PROGRESS]**

- [ ] **Update response generator** - Populate new status columns when generating responses
- [ ] **Create review CLI script** - Simple interface to review/approve responses  
- [ ] **Filter posting system** - Only post approved responses

---

## Phase 4: Complete Workflow Integration ‚è≥ **[PENDING]**

- [ ] **Collection** ‚Üí Master CSV with unreplied reviews ‚úÖ (partially done)
- [ ] **Response Generation** ‚Üí Add AI responses with `pending_review` status
- [ ] **Human Review** ‚Üí Update status to `approved`/`rejected`
- [ ] **Automated Posting** ‚Üí Post only approved responses and update status
- [ ] **Status Tracking** ‚Üí Full audit trail of entire process

---

## Phase 5: GitHub Actions Update ‚è≥ **[PENDING]**

- [ ] Update workflow to handle new CSV structure
- [ ] Add human review notification emails
- [ ] Ensure proper status management

---

## üîß TECHNICAL NOTES

### Current File Structure:
- `src/collectors/review_collector.py` ‚úÖ Working (with duplicate prevention)
- `src/processors/Generate_Responses.py` ‚úÖ Working 
- `src/posters/post_Suggested_Responses_Batch.py` ‚úÖ Working
- `data/reviews_master_database.csv` ‚ùå **MISSING** (needs creation)
- `AUTOMATION_SETUP.md` ‚ùå **INCORRECT** (claims SQLite)

### GitHub Actions:
- `.github/workflows/daily-review-collection.yml` ‚úÖ Created
- Repository secrets ‚úÖ Configured (assumed)
- Testing status ‚ùì **NEEDS VERIFICATION**

---

## üö® IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS

**CRITICAL DECISION:** Current CSV-based architecture is fundamentally flawed for GitHub Actions environment. 

**RECOMMENDED PATH:** Migrate to Serverless + Free Database Architecture (detailed in `ARCHITECTURE_MIGRATION.md`)

1. **Review `ARCHITECTURE_MIGRATION.md`** - Complete migration plan with 5-hour timeline
2. **Start Phase 1: Database Setup** - Create Supabase account and schema (30 min)
3. **Implement database integration** - Replace CSV logic with proper persistence
4. **Test new architecture** - End-to-end validation

**Alternative:** Fix current system temporarily, but expect ongoing issues with state management in GitHub Actions.

---

## üí¨ THREAD HANDOVER NOTES

**CONTEXT:** User lost confidence due to extended troubleshooting session. Current architecture has fundamental issues.

**DECISION MADE:** Migrate to better architecture with zero monthly costs ($0 requirement)

**For future Claude instances:**
- **READ `ARCHITECTURE_MIGRATION.md` FIRST** - Complete migration plan ready for implementation
- This TODO list tracks current broken system - new system bypasses these issues
- User prioritizes: better long-term solution + minimal costs
- Current GitHub Actions workflow fails due to missing data/ directory (expected)

**Critical Files for Migration:**
1. `ARCHITECTURE_MIGRATION.md` - **START HERE**
2. `src/collectors/review_collector.py` - needs database integration
3. `src/processors/Generate_Responses.py` - needs database integration  
4. `.github/workflows/daily-review-collection.yml` - needs database credentials

**Current Broken Issues (to be fixed by migration):**
- CSV files in gitignored folder = no persistence in CI/CD
- GitHub Actions environment doesn't have data/ directory
- Manual CSV editing for human review = poor UX
- Repository structure confusion (subfolder issues)
